## ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on OrderCast

[OrderCast](https://ordercast.io) enables wholesalers to shift their B2B ordering process online by quickly transforming spreadsheets of product listings into an online shop.

I'm responsible for creating a new version of a top-notch product. As always, it would be scalable, robust, and incredibly fast.
